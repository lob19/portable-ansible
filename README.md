# Self-contained Ansible distribution

Ansible package with required python modules. No need to install, just download, unpack and use. The main idea of this package is to run Ansible playbooks on local machine.

The distribution contains only `ansible-base`. The extra dependencies will need to be installed manually. 

## Changelog

This fork is an updated version of the upstream, works with latest python (3.12) and ansible (2.16)

## How to install and use

Latest version of portable-ansible tarball (.tar.bz2) is available on
Releases page https://github.com/ownport/portable-ansible/releases

```sh
wget https://github.com/ownport/portable-ansible/releases/download/<version>/portable-ansible-<version>-py3.tar.bz2 \
      -O ansible.tar.bz2

tar -xjf ansible.tar.bz2

python3 ansible localhost -m ping
 [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available

localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

### Hints

If you need to run ansible playbooks, after having extracted the tarball contents run next commands to create aliases to portable ansible directory. In the examples below `portable-ansible` installed in `/opt` directory
```sh
python3 ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

To have all the ansible commands, run:
```sh
for l in config console doc galaxy inventory playbook pull vault;do
  ln -s ansible ansible-$l
done
```

## Supporting additional python packages

Install python packages into `ansible/extras` directory
```
pip3 install -t ansible/extras <package>
```
or 
```
pip3 install -t ansible/extras -r requirements.txt
```

Instead of installing the python packages to `ansible/extras`, you can also install them in user directory to be available for ansible:
```
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```
